# testingEff
Simple Java program that tests the average time it takes to fill a Stack using both Array and Linked List implementations.
You can choose how many times you want to fill the each stack at the start. For any number of iterations you choose (let's call it k), it will fill each stack with every number from 1 to 100 k times.
The program terminates once you set k to -1
